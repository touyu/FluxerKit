# FluxerKit
Flux framework inspired by [ReactorKit](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit)

## Introduction

ReactorKit is a very awesome framework.
It brings order to the code.

However, There are parts of ReactorKit that I don't like.
1. Must use `distinctUntilChanged` when observing changes in state.
2. Unstable `Method Swizzling`
3. No official `carthage` support

FluxerKit solve these.
