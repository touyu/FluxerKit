# FluxerKit
Flux framework inspired by [ReactorKit](https://github.com/ReactorKit/ReactorKit)

## Introduction

ReactorKit is a very awesome framework.
It brings order to the code.

However, There are parts of ReactorKit that I don't like.
1. Must use `distinctUntilChanged` when observing changes in state.
2. Can't create an element of state without initial value
3. Unstable `Method Swizzling`
4. No official carthage support

FluxerKit solve these.
